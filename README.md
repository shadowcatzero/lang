# the

my child (programming language)

everything is subject to change rn, and this probably isn't up to date
also nothing is super well tested right now so I'm sure there are bugs I don't think exist

`cargo run -- data/test.lang`

currently working!!:
- functions (arguments, returning)
- assembly blocks (input, output for expression)
- structs (construction, field access, modifying, nesting)

todo:
- generics (groundwork is there I think)
- traits (unsure exactly how I wanna do this, either way need number ones)
- actually handle jumps & LIs that are too large
- iterators?
- borrow checking
- basic optimization: use registers, remove temp var moves
- Cow str
