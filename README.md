# the

my child (programming language)

everything is subject to change rn, and this probably isn't up to date

`cargo run -- data/test.lang`

currently working!!:
- functions (arguments, returning)
- assembly blocks (input, output for expression)
- kind of structs (construction, field access, but not modifying lmao)

todo:
- actually handle jumps & LIs that are too large
- iterators?
- borrow checking
- multiple var instances for struct fields / fix all that stuff
- basic optimization: use registers, remove temp var moves
